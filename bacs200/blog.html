					<h2>Social Implications</h2>
					<p>&lt;Immanuel Kant forms an argument that the only creatures who are owed moral consideration are rational creatures. But this conclusion indicated that we as people only owe moral consideration, or giving careful thought to proper conduct, directly to humans and not animals. In this page we will discuss why there needs to be further explination of the topic. There are many contraversies that arrise when it comes to animal cruilty. In this case, we will take a closer look Immanuel Kant's theory. He was a German philosopher and one of the central Enlightenment thinkers.</p>

					<h2>Economical Implications</h2>
					<p>&lt;Kant would say it’s wrong to kick a dog for the same reasons as it is wrong to lie to a person. This is considering that since kicking a dog was not out of goodwill, then it is not ok just like lying is not out of goodwill. Kant would claim that we have duties to all human beings and so even those who suffer from severe mental retardation or late-stage Alzheimer’s disease deserve the right to common dignity and respect. This portion is the one I agree with, but I believe Krant is wrong regarding his claim that we have duties only to rational creatures. Animals bring much happiness, companionship, and even mental/physical support to humans; therefore we owe duties such as being respectful and caring to animals, for example, our pets.</p>

					<h2>Political Implications</h2>
					<p>&lt;I disagree with Kant on this, since all people and all animals deserve to be treated kindly. I believe he is wrong because all animals have rights, not just humans. Just because animals are not able to have conscious thought, that does not make it ok for humans to take advantage of this and use it as superiority to be cruel to animals. Kant’s views regarding the treatment of animals vs. the treatment of human beings are that as humans do not have any duties to animals, yet that we should refrain from pointless cruelty to animals. Another claim of Krant’s theory was that cruelty to animals leads to cruelty to humans since it demonstrates how someone would treat humankind. We have morals and a sense of intuition that helps us decipher what is right and wrong, and this has to be used to understand that we are in no right to treat animals with cruelty.</p>

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>&lt;Kant’s theory regarding cruelty to animals compared to cruelties with human state that we only owe ethical duties to rational beings, and animals are not in that group. Yet, he believed that the avoidng cruelty to animals will avoid building cruel habits inflicted on other people. Animals may not be rational creatures but serve us, and we owe duties such as being respectful. Animals offer us happiness and companionship, and just because we have conscious thought we can’t be cruel, instead because they are innocent creatures we must respect them.&nbsp;</p>
